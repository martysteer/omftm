# Our Mutual Friend The Machine
https://beinghumanfestival.org/event/our-mutual-friend-the-machine/

**Repository information:**

This repository contains the code and (most of) the files which were used for the Being Human event in November 2019.

Open the notebook in Google Colab and run the cells. It will copy and pull in relevant models and metadata files, which are stored in the releases of this github repository.


**Data source info:**

The Google Colab notebook is a modified version of Max Woolf's notebook: [How To Make Custom AI-Generated Text With GPT-2](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/)

The GPT2 model was built by Gwern, who makes it available for download from his website. For full details on how it was built, or to access the original model, see the webpage https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2. To make the model work with google drive, google colab and the gpt_2_simple python library the model had to be unzipped and it's contents restructured a bit to include file/checkpoint info. The model is approx 1.23GB and can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/martysteer/omftm/releases/tag/Gwern-GPT-2-345M If you run the cells in the notebook, it will download the model into your google drive and collab environment.

The Gutenburg poetry corpus is available here: https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/

The gutenburgmetadata.json file is a slightly restructured version of the json from this project: https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/



**Event information:**

November 20, 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm

Want to become the modern day Dickens, but need a little help? Come along to this event exploring how story-generating computer programmes could be the answer. Through flash talks and poetry performances discover how the computer has learnt to say more than ‘no’. Then turn your hand (or typing fingers) to writing stories. Enter a handful of words and phrases into the programme and see what masterpiece the machine helps you create.

Flash talks will cover the digital possibilities, from asking online communities to crack Dickens’ unsolved murder mystery, to seeing whether the Victorians’ futuristic ideas about talking books came true. However, don’t forget the old-fashioned human author as throughout the night a poet will give spoken word performances and go up against the machine to create a brand new work.

In the second part of the evening mingle amongst our interactive stalls to generate your own stories, join the ‘Save the Author’ protest and become an online detective. With a drink in hand see if you find the machine a friend or foe.

Flash talks given by:

- Professor Matt Rubery, Queen Mary University of London
- Professor Jane Winters and Martin Steer, School of Advanced Study, University of London
- Dr Pete Orford, The University of Buckingham
- Laila Sumpton, poet and writer

Organised by: School of Advanced Study, University of London
In partnership with: Poet Laila Sumpton
